# PARKING_SPACE_COUNTER
Parking space counter is a system that uses computer vision to count the number of available parking spaces in a parking lot. It can be used to improve traffic flow and reduce parking congestion.

The system works by first using OpenCV to capture images of the parking lot. The images are then processed using image processing techniques to identify the parking spaces. The system can then count the number of empty parking spaces and display the number on a screen or dashboard.

Here are some additional details about the steps involved in implementing a parking space counter system:

i)Identify the parking spaces: The first step is to identify the parking spaces in the parking lot. This can be done by using a physical survey or by using computer vision techniques.

ii)Capture images of the parking lot: Once the parking spaces have been identified, images of the parking lot can be captured using a camera. The images should be captured in a consistent manner so that the system can accurately identify the parking spaces.

iii)Process the images: The images can then be processed using image processing techniques to identify the parking spaces. The system can use a variety of techniques to identify the parking spaces, such as color detection, edge detection, and shape detection.

iv)Count the number of available parking spaces: Once the parking spaces have been identified, the system can count the number of available parking spaces. The system can do this by simply counting the number of empty parking spaces.

v)Display the number of available parking spaces:The number of available parking spaces can then be displayed on a screen or dashboard. This information can be used by drivers to find parking spaces more quickly.
